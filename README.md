# ❤️ Valentine Proposal Website

This is a fun and interactive Valentine’s Day proposal website that playfully encourages the user to accept the proposal. If they keep clicking "No," the button text changes, the "Yes" button grows, and cute GIFs appear. Eventually, when they click "Yes," confetti bursts to celebrate the moment! 🎉

## 🎯 Features

- **🎭 Playful No Button** – Changes text and images, making it harder to say "No."

- **🎨 Beautiful UI** – Responsive and visually appealing design.

- **🎊 Confetti Celebration** – Confetti animation when "Yes" is clicked.

- **🎞️ GIF Support** – Different GIFs displayed dynamically.

- **📱 Mobile Friendly** – Works seamlessly on mobile devices.
